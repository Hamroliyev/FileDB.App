This development is about using files as a database (I know this is ridiculous idea)

# .NET Console App - Text/JSON Database CRUD

This .NET console application allows you to use either a text file or a JSON file as a database to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
      git clone [here](https://github.com/Hamroliyev/FileDB.App.git)
   

2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, etc.)

3. Build the solution to restore the dependencies.

4. Run the application.

Usage

- Upon running the application, you will be prompted to choose the type of file database you would like to use (txt or JSON).
- Follow the on-screen instructions to perform CRUD operations on the selected file database.
- You can create new records, read existing records, update records, and delete records.

File Database

The application allows you to use either a text file or a JSON file as the database for storing records. The choice of using a text file (.txt) or a JSON file (.json) will determine the structure of the database.
